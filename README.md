# Key-Value Store Project

## Overview
This project implements a simple key-value store system. It supports basic operations such as adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting key-value pairs. The goal is to demonstrate understanding of data storage, file handling, and basic algorithms for efficient key lookups.

## Features
- Store key-value pairs persistently using a file-based database.
- Retrieve values by key.
- Update existing keys with new values.
- Delete keys from the store.
- Handles duplicate key entries safely.

## Files
- `kvstore.py` — Main Python script implementing the key-value store.
- `data.db` — Local file for storing key-value data.
- `README.txt` — Project overview and usage instructions.

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Open a terminal or PowerShell window in the project directory.
3. Run the program:
